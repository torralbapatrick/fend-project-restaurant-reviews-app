# Restaurant Reviews App

This project is completed as part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Front End Nanodegree Program. I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. My job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality based on the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view).

## Getting Started

1. Download the GithHub zip file or clone the repository
    * [zip file](https://github.com/torralbapatrick/fend-project-restaurant-reviews-app/archive/master.zip)
    * [git clone](https://github.com/torralbapatrick/fend-project-restaurant-reviews-app)
2. `cd` into newly cloned repository
    * Check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use). For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
    * Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`
4. Or you can check the hosted site [here](https://torralbapatrick.github.io/fend-project-restaurant-reviews-app/)
